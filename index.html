    excerpt: "This website is my attempt to document, in one location, various STEM concepts I hope to incorporate in a Maker space some day. It contains tutorials and links to resources useful for learning STEM, with a focus on Raspberry Pi (and other Linux distros), Scratch, Python, javascript, and circuits. It is meant to be a reference tool and not a step-by-step guide. If you are interested in STEM and Linux, and want to learn more in those areas, then hopefully the information here will be useful."

    excerpt: "My background is in engineering. I worked in semiconductor manufacturing and the computer science classes I took in college proved to be the most useful in my career. Those experiences grew an interest I've always had in STEM. I have learned a lot in the process and enjoy sharing that info with others. A large portion of the material on the site come from key resources I've learned from including wiki, stackexchange, w3schools, freecodecamp, etc."
